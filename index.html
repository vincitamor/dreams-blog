                <h5>If you are like me, then I am sure the simple thought about dreams and its complicated nature excites you. I am getting excited just even writing about it. Dreams are indeed a spectacular phenomenon, one in which has been discussed for centuries due to its unexplainable nature and well deserving of the attention it has receieved. Many known figures throughout history have had theories and beliefs of their own, some contradicting one or the other, but nonetheless all are interesting and credible in their own ways. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March 17, 2023</h5>

    <p>
    Think about the last time you had an odd dream but there was one<br> piece of info which you recognized. Well, it is believed that dreams<br> occur on the foundation of something we know or have seen,<br> and it creates life for it in the form of our dreams.

In the cognitive part of your brain,

<p>It is important to understand that dreams do not arise from nothing. 
<br>They have a purpose, a psychical and subconscious purpose which<br> cannot be explained, but can be understood by the dreamer if they wish.

<h2>What <em>causes</em> dreams?</h2>
<p>Dream-life is something which has been pondered<br> and researched but there is no definitive answer, yet.
<br>Some reasons for dreaming can be explained as:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreams can arise due to somatic stimulation while the dream is asleep.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreams can be <em>experiences or thoughts</em> which occurred yesterday, or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years before which come in the form of an <strong>odd and twisted version of a dream.</strong></li>
</ol>

<h2>Where dreams do <em>NOT</em> arise from</h2>
<section>
<h3>Some reasonings may be...:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dreams are not a cause of divine reason.</li>
<li>Dreams do not randomly come to the dreamer.</li>
<li>Dreams are not from imaginative experiences.</li>

Curious to know how to better remember your dreams?
</summary>
<p>
Before you sleep, <mark>make yourself aware</mark> that you will dream, and focus on that thought so when you wake up, it will be the first thought which comes to mind. Sleeping at <time datetime="10:00">10 pm</time> and sleeping for <time datetime="PT8H">8 hours</time> is also beneficial.
