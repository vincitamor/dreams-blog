    <h2 class="maintitle">Things I LOVE!</h2>
<ol>
<li>I thoroughly enjoy learning, it was not something I particularly took interest in while I was younger, but have came to deeply appreciate the knowledge from learning.</li>
<li>I initially wanted to be a pro-gamer...
<br>I know, what the heck? Gaming was all I looked forward to, I never realized I was above average in skill, but it turned out that I was somewhat pretty good!
</li>
<li>I was very obsessed with how the mind works, I mean I can go on and on about why, but here are some reasons <em>why</em>:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreams. I mean, come on, do I need to say more?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can move your whole body, fingers, and toes with a mere THOUGHT. Pretty eff'n cool if you ask me.</li>
<li>My dogs, whom I love very dearly are the greatest buds, here is a <img src="shutterstock_Cute-Dog.avif" alt="Cute dog photo"> of one of them. If you really think he is that cute, you can <a href="shutterstock_Cute-Dog.avif" download>download</a> his photo:)!</li>

<h2 class="maintitle">Things I do NOT love...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Oh this is simple, one word, cancer. I mean who loves that disgusting word and all that comes with it? F*** Cancer.</li>
<li>As I think about what I am going to type I can already feel the hate coming my way but I absolutely HATE cheese, <br>it is not something I would ever want to eat, unless it is on pizza.</li>
<li>I am really not a big fan of any type of sports. I am unsure why that is, but I have just never really been into them.</li>
